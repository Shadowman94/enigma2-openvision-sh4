# Map receiver model name to a remote control name
# it is expected there will be 'remote control name'.png
# and 'remote control name'.xml file in this directroy.
#
# As a receiver may be able to be used with several remotes
# indicated by the value in the /proc/stb/ir/rc/type file
# the format of each line is:
#
#    ModelName[.RcType]  remoteName
#
# So the .RcType is optional and allows to define multiple
# remote controls for a receiver model.
#
# Lookup first tries to find a "ModelName.RcType remoteName" entry,
# and if not found it scans for a  "ModelName  remoteName" entry.
# So basically, when a rctype is specified that has no definition,
# a default rc model will be used for ModelName.
#
# When no entry matches at all, 'default' will be used as remoteName
